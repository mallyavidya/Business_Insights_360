## Project Overview  

### Background  

Atliq, a leading IT hardware provider, faced challenges in efficiently managing and analyzing performance across finance, sales, marketing, supply chain, and executive decision-making. I created a series of interactive dashboards to give Atliq’s leadership a holistic view of these functions, enabling them to make data-driven decisions for strategic growth. Each dashboard targets a specific department, delivering actionable insights to support Atliq’s market objectives.

## Objective

The objective was to process and structure Atliq’s historical data to develop key business insights, using **Power Query** for data cleaning and **DAX** for custom calculations. The result is a suite of interactive dashboards, providing department-specific intelligence.

## Dashboard Suite Overview

This project includes five dashboards, each tailored to Atliq’s major operational areas: **Finance**, **Sales**, **Marketing**, **Supply Chain**, and **Executive View**.

### 1. Finance View  

This Finance View dashboard in the Business 360 project provides a comprehensive snapshot of Atliq’s financial trends. It highlights revenue, profit margins, and cost breakdowns over time, enabling the finance team to identify profitable regions, manage cost centers, and uncover growth opportunities effectively. Key performance indicators like Net Sales, Gross Margin, and Net Profit percentage provide a quick overview of financial health compared to the previous year. The Profit & Loss statement further breaks down revenue and expenses, helping to pinpoint areas of improvement.

Regional and segment analysis offers deeper insights, showcasing the highest and lowest-performing markets and product lines. Monthly trend analysis adds context, allowing the team to spot seasonal patterns or external impacts on performance. This finance view empowers Atliq’s financial team to make data-driven decisions, optimize costs, and prioritize high-growth areas for strategic planning.
